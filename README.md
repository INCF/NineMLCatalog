NineML Catalog
========

The NineML Catalog is a collection of NineML models (see http://nineml.net)
written in XML. See http://nineml.net/software/ for a list of software that
have support for NineML.

Also included is a thin Python module 'ninemlcatalog'
for convenient access to the models stored in the catalog using the lib9ML
Python library (see http://github.com/INCF/lib9ML).


The NineML Calalog is maintained by the NineML committee
(http://nineml.net/committee).
